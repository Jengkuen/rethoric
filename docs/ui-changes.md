# Original Changes Completed ✅

1. ✅ Cards representing chats in left panel is too information dense. It should be a simple title for simplicity
2. ✅ Left panel should be sticky when scrolling in the chat.
3. ✅ Chat interface is too cluttered with timestamps, profile icons. it should follow a chatgpt interface.
4. ✅ Chat box in chat interface should be sticky. it should always stay on screen regardless of chat scroll position.
5. ✅ There should be a profile icon in the bottom left of the left pane to open up a small modal just like claude's UI that shows links to settings and logout functionality.
