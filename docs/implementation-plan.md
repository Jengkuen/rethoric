## Development Guidelines

### Phase Isolation Principles
1. **Clear Dependencies**: Each phase has explicit dependencies on previous phases
2. **Testable Boundaries**: Each phase has well-defined testing criteria
3. **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers working functionality
4. **Rollback Safety**: Each phase can be reverted without affecting others

### AI Development Considerations
1. **Atomic Commits**: Each feature should be implemented in focused, atomic commits
2. **Clear Documentation**: Every function and component should have clear purpose documentation
3. **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests before implementing features where possible
4. **Modular Architecture**: Design components to be easily understood and modified by AI

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All code must pass automated linting and type checking
- **Testing**: Each phase must achieve 80%+ test coverage
- **Performance**: All features must meet specified performance criteria
- **User Testing**: Each phase should be validated with real user scenarios

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Development**: Some phases can be developed in parallel where dependencies allow
- **Fallback Plans**: Each critical feature should have fallback implementations
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring should be implemented from Phase 1
- **Documentation**: All architectural decisions should be documented for future reference

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building Rethoric with clear phase boundaries, comprehensive testing strategies, and AI-friendly development practices. Each phase builds incrementally toward the complete product while maintaining isolation for easy development and testing.
